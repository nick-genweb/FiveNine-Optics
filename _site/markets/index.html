          FiveNine Optics is essential to emerging technologies because they require optics with uncompromised performance and durability.  Applications in trace-gas sensing, physics, and quantum computing rely on optics with exceptionally low losses to achieve high finesses in optical cavities.  At the same time, Directed Energy and Fusion programs demand coatings with extremely high LIDT, strong FOD resistance, and availability in large formats.

        <h2>QUANTUM</h2>
        <p>Many quantum systems depend on precision optics and high-finesse cavities to probe and manipulate qubits. For years, FNO has supplied leading atomic-physics groups with the lowest-loss mirrors available. Those same scientists—and the optics they rely on—are now driving the breakthroughs that are defining modern quantum technology. As quantum platforms scale in complexity and performance demands grow, FNO remains a crucial partner in enabling the next generation of quantum innovation.</p>
