          <li>We develop revolutionary methods for redesigning IBS machines, both new and old, to support a range of novel coating capabilities</li>
          <li>Our enhanced IBS machines incorporate groundbreaking "monitoring" platform to achieve predictable and reliable optical coatings</li>
          <li>NFO's proprietary monitoring technology supports in-situ monitoring even for large format optics with complex coating structures</li>
          <li>Our team has built/modified over 30 IBS Machines over their extensive careers</li>
          <li>Cutting-edge coatings are vital to the US government, resulting in a $1.8M (2024) government-sponsored retrofit of an existing IBS machine to further expand FiveNine's capabilities</li>

          <li>Uniquely qualified to offer in-house, best-in-class super polishing</li>
          <li>FiveNine established polishing process and metrology tools required for production of best in class, super-polished substrates with sub-angstrom rms roughness for critical scientific and industrial applications requiring low optical loss</li>
          <li>Proprietary instrumentation for characterizing the rms roughness of super-polished surfaces</li>
          <li>Super-polishing substrates in-house eliminates key sourcing risks impacting quality and timing</li>
          <li>Our super-polishing facility is focused on high quality surfaces for a narrow range of curvatures and form factors</li>
          <li>We do not currently sell uncoated substrates, instead focusing on selling high margin coated optics in lower volumes</li>
          <li>We partner with highly technical and capable specialty polishing shops when large substrates are needed.</li>
