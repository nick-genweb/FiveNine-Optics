          <li>We specialize in Ion Beam Sputtered coatings. IBS coatings are spectrally deterministic, dense, durable, and exhibit the lowest losses and highest LIDT's available.</li>
          <li>We develop and operate revolutionary IBS machines to support a range of novel coating capabilities, including multi-band coatings for both low-loss and high-power applications.</li>
          <li>FNO has made strides in overcoming issues that limited IBS coatings in the past: size, and LIDT (legacy perception does not put IBS at the top, current results do).</li>
          <li>FOD resistant coatings have become vital to national security. FNO's trailblazing performance has brought government-sponsored upgrades to our production capacity for large optics.</li>

          <li>Achieving Five-Nine performance (R > 0.99999) requires both a super-polished substrate and a low-loss IBS coating. FNO offers both.</li>
          <li>FNO performs super-polishing in-house to maintain complete control over quality and throughput.</li>
          <li>Our polishing process and metrology deliver best-in-class surface quality with sub-angstrom RMS roughness.</li>
