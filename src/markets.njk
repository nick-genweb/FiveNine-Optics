          FiveNine Optics is essential to emerging technologies because they require optics with uncompromised performance and durability.  Applications in trace-gas sensing, physics, and quantum computing rely on optics with exceptionally low losses to achieve high finesses in optical cavities.  At the same time, Directed Energy and Fusion programs demand coatings with extremely high LIDT, strong FOD resistance, and availability in large formats.

        <h2>FUSION</h2>
        <p>Fusion energy is a challenging but essential pursuit for humanity's future. Fusion reactors (and high-power laser systems used to ignite fusion) create extremely demanding environments. FNO is continuously expanding the limits of what optical components can withstand and what can be produced at scale, delivering the high-LIDT and large-format optics required to support the next breakthroughs in fusion development.</p>

        <h2>DIRECTED ENERGY</h2>
        <p>Directed energy systems rely on high-power lasers to deliver focused energy over long distances. These applications demand optical components that can handle extreme intensities without degradation. FNO specializes in ultra-low-loss, high-LIDT mirrors and coatings designed for the most demanding laser platforms. Our precision manufacturing ensures the reliability and performance needed for next-generation directed energy technologies.</p>

        <h2>QUANTUM</h2>
        <p>Many quantum systems depend on precision optics and high-finesse cavities to probe and manipulate qubits. For years, FNO has supplied leading atomic-physics groups with the lowest-loss mirrors available. Those same scientists—and the optics they rely on—are now driving the breakthroughs that are defining modern quantum technology. As quantum platforms scale in complexity and performance demands grow, FNO remains a crucial partner in enabling the next generation of quantum innovation.</p>
